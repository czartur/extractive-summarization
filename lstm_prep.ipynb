'<vocalsound> Okay , so <vocalsound>', 'these were the basic findings from today .', 'The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email .', 'Uh I just quickly jotted them down .', 'Um <vocalsound> so', 'basically uh the <disfmarker>', 'as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <vocalsound> and how the parts uh communicate with each other .', 'Um <vocalsound> okay ,', 'so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated ,', 'so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .', 'also uh the remote control should be used only for television ,', 'because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex .', 'And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television .', 'How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the <vocalsound> the use for television , <vocalsound> in order to keep things simple .', 'Um <vocalsound>', 'also the management wants that um our design should be unique', 'uh it <disfmarker>', 'so <vocalsound> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .', '<vocalsound> Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control .', 'Um <vocalsound>', \"there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface .\", 'The user interf interface communicates with the chip ,', \"so <vocalsound> I'll basic go over to the <disfmarker>\", 'Okay .', '<vocalsound> So <vocalsound>', 'if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates <disfmarker> uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything .', 'There is a user interface here .', '<vocalsound> So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip', 'and the chip then generates a response', 'and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,', 'um which then <disfmarker>', 'so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code ,', 'which is then communicated <vocalsound> to the remote site ,', 'which h has an infrared receiver .', 'Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .', 'so these are the essent', 'so a all the functionality of the remote control ,', 'whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .', '<vocalsound> Okay .', '<vocalsound> Um so <vocalsound>', \"i in my personal preferences um <vocalsound> I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .\", 'This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a

have any um i idea about costs at this point ?', \"<vocalsound> No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .\", '<vocalsound> Br', 'Um yeah .', 'Okay .', \"'Cause that's something to consider , I guess ,\", \"if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .\", 'Yeah .', 'Certainly , yeah .', 'So so tha', 'yeah , <vocalsound>', 'we definitely need to

um for the for the whole um period of the um <vocalsound> all the project but it's just at th at this very moment .\", 'uh my method was um to look at um other <vocalsound> um remote controls ,', 'uh so mostly just by searching on the web', 'and to see what um functionality they used .', 'And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .', '<vocalsound> And yeah , and then just to um <vocalsound> put the main function of the remote control in in words .', 'Um so the findings uh were <vocalsound> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set ,', 'so this quite straightforward .', 'And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,', 'uh then the user would like to switch the channel', 'um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels ,', 'or then mm <vocalsound> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel ,', 'so we would need the numbers .', 'And and also the volume is very important .', 'Um <vocalsound>', 'um <vocalsound> I als', '<vocalsound> Sorry ,', 'cou could you go back for a second ?', 'okay .', 'Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , <vocalsound>', \"okay , that's great .\", \"'Kay .\", 'Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <vocalsound> functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ ,', \"but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players ,\", 'but then <vocalsound> there are <disfmarker> surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them ,', 'but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .', 'So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size .', 'And then it must be easy to use ,', 'so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button', 'and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .', 'Um then <disfmarker> <vocalsound>', 'yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then <vocalsound> the channel numbers', 'and then um <vocalsound> the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel ,', 'and then volume has to be there .', 'But then um other functionalities um <vocalsound> could be just <disfmarker>', 'uh there could be a menu button', 'and you could change things on the screen then ,', 'um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <vocalsound> done through the menu .', 'And yeah ,', 'the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities ,', 'the answer was already no because

\"It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .\", 'Yeah ,', \"and also it's it's um <disfmarker> other question is uh because there are so many different <disfmarker> And there are so many

<disfmarker> I mean in <disfmarker> we can completely do away with buttons', 'and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that .', 'But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on

also the switch .', 'yeah <vocalsound> .', '<vocalsound> Okay .', \"Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before .\", 'But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation

<disfmarker> uh the the charger any', 'With the remote control .', 'in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .', 'Okay', 'so the price of the charger included in the

okay .', \"It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <vocalsound> .\", 'You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control', 'But <disfmarker>', 'Uh yeah yeah', 'you should present that .', 'And this is other one ?', 'that that you ca you can add up <vocalsound> to the <disfmarker> to your remote control', 'i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .', '<vocalsound> Yeah .', 'H here is just the the the module for the kids', 'and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up <disfmarker> they come up with their modules ,', 'Mm hmm hmm hmm .', 'they just plug in it', 'Yeah <vocalsound>', 'and they can have all the control they want here .', 'We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,', 'and it acts like the previous one ,', 'Yeah .', 'you just plug in and it works .', '<vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound>', 'the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .', 'Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons ,', 'powerful is that all the controls with <vocalsound> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n', 'but here you only have few buttons', 'but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities .', 'But in addition with simplicity .', \"So that's the best idea ,\", 'the cond that', \"that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <vocalsound> .\", 'Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you .', 'The first one is the speech recogniser ,', \"again it's detachable or add-on .\", 'And then we also have security feature', 'for example this here <disfmarker> oop <vocalsound>', \"it's very robust <gap> ,\", \"it doesn't break\", \"and the material , what's the material again ?\", 'The titanium', \"and so it's very uh <disfmarker>\", 'Titanium .', 'Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one ,', 'again because this is A_A_

'and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .', \"So when you finish watching your T_V_ <vocalsound> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger ,\", \"so so that's the <disfmarker> or is it <disfmarker>\", 'Okay .', \"that's the reminder part .\", 'Yeah', 'and um <disfmarker>', 'And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary ,', \"so we didn't define the vocabulary\", \"so it's up to the user to define\", 'Mm hmm hmm hmm .', 'so <disfmarker>', 'sorry ? <vocalsound>', 'And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a <gap> of T_V_ programmes by genre ,', 'and this can be used by the adult or by the children .', 'So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night .', \"So it's pretty powerful ,\", \"and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature .\", 'Yeah .',

we can improve more on the design but <vocalsound>', \"What what's <disfmarker>\", 'Maybe yeah .', \"What's the price to p to produce ?\", '<disfmarker> uh this is the <vocalsound> <disfmarker>',

<vocalsound> <disfmarker>\", \"We don't have all the options <vocalsound> .\", 'so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .', \"Charger we don't have charger here either .\", '<vocalsound> Yeah .', \"No it's\", \"But it's just if you want all functionalities .\", \"it's below the the the budget .\", 'Yeah <vocalsound> .', 'Excuse me ?', \"It's below the bu the budget .\", \"Yeah it's a nice input\", 'We <disfmarker>', 'but we have an other inputs from the l public demands .', 'I think we will just have a rough look', 'and then we can make our statements ,', 'and we can finalise the product based on this discu', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah .', 'I think we can just go to my presentation then .', 'We can wind up .', 'Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .', 'So the marketing made an evaluation criteria', 'and these were some of the findings ,', 'and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface ,', 'but most of the people what they are interested is <disfmarker> first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel ,', 'it should be very fancy with colourful', 'and uh very handy to hold .', 'And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .', 'Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative .', 'And the third one is easy to use .', 'Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself', \"since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .\", 'Okay and if we go to the next slide ,', 'here you can find <disfmarker> these are the latest fashion updates ,', \"and so this <disfmarker> in Paris and Milan <gap> they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable ,\", 'so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .', 'Spongy spongy .', 'Mm mm .', 'So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .', 'Mm <vocalsound> mm .', 'And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium ,', 'it should be somewhat spongy .', 'Okay .', 'But the the problem is that uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> is it robust to mishandling ?', 'We have <disfmarker>', 'you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <vocalsound> .', 'A sponge . <vocalsound>', 'Yeah so uh <vocalsound> so finally we have these three criterias .', 'Spongy <vocalsound> .', 'One is fancy look ,', 'second is innovative ,', 'and third is easy to use .', '<vocalsound> So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .', 'So <disfmarker> and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these ,', 'say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,', 'and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .', 'So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ,', 'so on this scale , if it is true , if it is <disfmarker> if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one ,', \"or if it is false , it doesn't <disfmarker> it looks uh <disfmarker> it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .\", 'So <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> So <gap>', '<vocalsound> We can make our study on this and <disfmarker>', 'so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?', 'No no', 'we have <disfmarker> you have designed two products now ,', 'Yeah .', 'one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah .', 'But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?', 'You .', 'According to you ,', 'no', 'according to you designers ,', 'how will feel <disfmarker> does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?', 'Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ .', 'On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look <disfmarker> how does it look ?', \"D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?\", \"Well it doesn't look much fancy\", \"I'll I'll say three or four .\", 'And you both agree for that ?', 'And you ?', '<vocalsound> I think we can improve on the design .', 'Yeah .', 'Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh <gap> <vocalsound> design .', \"It's it it <disfmarker>\", 'Um we have been focused all all this <vocalsound> time on the <vocalsound> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .', 'Technical aspects .', 'As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help <vocalsound> .', 'So I take three on <disfmarker> with L_C_D_ ?', 'Yeah a three .', 'So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?', 'Yeah <vocalsound> .', 'Uh four .', 'Four .', \"I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated\", 'so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .', 'Yeah .', '<vocalsound> Yeah .', 'And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .', \"Well it's it's the same for both\", 'so <vocalsound> I will give a five , six . <vocalsound>', 'Five with L_C_D_ and <disfmarker>', 'Well five also uh', 'Yeah <vocalsound>', '<disfmarker> Norman please . <vocalsound>', 'Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker>', 'from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <vocalsound> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content ,', 'because uh that is really innovative ,', 'and for now <disfmarker> and another innovation we have is simplicity', \"and <disfmarker> simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A lot of functionalities .\", 'With lot of functionalities .', 'So without L_C_D_ ?', 'So that is uh that is uh for both th', 'Our gi', 'I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all', '<disfmarker> well this is a biased judgement <vocalsound>', 'No no', 'because we designed them .', 'according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?', 'Yeah . <vocalsound>', 'Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .', 'With L_C_D_ .', 'For L_C_D_ .', 'And without L_C_D_ ?', 'Both .', \"Mm for both it's the the same innovations .\", 'For both .', \"It's the same innovation .\", 'Okay .', 'So maybe I can put six to seven .', \"<gap> six , let's go for six .\", 'Without L_C_D_ .', 'Both .', 'No', 'actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts .', 'So I <disfmarker> there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y', 'Yeah .', 'then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .', 'Uh no innovative yeah .', \"So we can't go <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\", 'Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?', '<vocalsound> Talk about <disfmarker>', \"We haven't really uh determined <vocalsound> what are <disfmarker> actually actually\", \"I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design <disfmarker>\", \"it's good to have a L_C_D_\", 'but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ?

template .', 'Sorry about that .', 'Oh right .', \"Okay alright so let's have a look here .\", \"Okay so this was the method that um I've taken .\", 'Here we go .', 'Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .', 'Okay .', \"And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information ,\", 'and then sort of bring us all together into it to see <disfmarker> sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .', \"Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us ,\", 'and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far ,', 'and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options', 'so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project .', 'Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?', 'Yep .', 'I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do ,', \"so that's why I suggested we get in this .\", 'Aye a fair point definitely .', 'Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay ,', 'and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .', 'Okay .', 'Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it .', 'Number two was that it be innovative .', 'Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it .', 'Uh and third priority uh for ease of use ,', 'so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um <vocalsound> quite user friendly while still having technology .', \"So it <disfmarker> I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing ,\", 'is that I think um <vocalsound> what we should think about is how the um <vocalsound> about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .', 'For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean ,', 'Aye right .', \"like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative\", 'Uh-huh .', 'because obviously the thing that <disfmarker>', 'the message here is ease of use .', 'So how do you make innovation make something more <vocalsound> more easy to use ?', \"Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .\", 'Okay .', \"Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um\", 'research I have here is on fashion style , okay ,', \"which as we've agreed is a priority .\", \"Uh top European fashion trend um <vocalsound> that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,\", 'especially in clothes and furniture .', 'And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it ,', 'or we get right into it ,', 'or we completely steer away from it ,', 'do you know what I mean ?', 'Okay okay .', 'So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend ,', 'but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .', \"Um 'cause I think what we're in\", \"what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer ,\", 'um <vocalsound> so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,', 'I think that would be pushing it .', 'And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy', 'and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle ,', 'which is <disfmarker> which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case .', \"So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode ,\", \"so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour .\", 'Um <disfmarker>', 'So these this is the summary of everything .', \"Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to .\", \"Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen <disfmarker> it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge ,\", 'uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout .', 'That was like the number three thing .', 'And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um', \"that's the way I interpreted it anyway ,\", 'softness in materials , shape , and function ,', \"and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods ,\", \"something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever ,\", \"but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .\", 'You know what a Mac iPod is ?', \"Mm that's true , yeah .\", \"I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's\", \"because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy ,\", \"so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod\", \"and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of\", '<disfmarker> or more of like a <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .', 'Um and then so this is', \"w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas ,\", 'and as we get into more the more um <vocalsound> techni like sort of production side of things ,', 'that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout .', 'Sort of like a <disfmarker>', 'I dunno like um', 'we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all ,', 'that we agree on ,', 'uh sorta like a marketing identity .', 'Um <disfmarker>', 'Does that make sense ?', 'Yeah .', 'So <vocalsound> so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever ,', \"it's just an idea ,\", \"'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their <disfmarker> what people associate this <disfmarker> them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .\", \"Mm 'kay .\", 'Great .', \"Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that ,\", 'you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas .', 'Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and <disfmarker>', 'Okay .', \"So anyway it's just just an idea .\", 'Yeah .', \"I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> into something which is <disfmarker> which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky\", 'because like um like something to do with like lighting within it .', 'Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .', 'How can we build on that ?', 'Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something', 'or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like', 'covers or something so .', 'Okay .', 'Anyway those are <disfmarker>', \"that's all I have ,\", 'but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into <disfmarker>', \"That's great .\", 'Uh-huh .', 'Okay great .', 'Um thank you for that .', 'Uh Craig do you wanna', 'Yep .', 'uh plug yours in then ?', 'Is it working ?', '<vocalsound> Mm .', 'Not quite .', 'Did you press F_ eight ?', \"It's probably not sending .\", 'Yeah .', 'Oh something coming now , yeah .', 'Yep , there it is .', 'There we go .', 'And so think of this concept .', \"Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again .\", \"It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls .\", \"Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there ,\", \"um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um <disfmarker>\", 'So then this <disfmarker>', \"we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons ,\", 'um the shape of the control ,', 'and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .', 'Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .', \"Um they're not very attractive to look at ,\", \"<vocalsound> and they're not very comfortable to hold ,\", \"they're <disfmarker>\", \"I just hold 'em like big bricks ,\", \"and they're very easily lost .\", 'Um they tend to be very dark colours ,', \"so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . <vocalsound>\", 'Um <vocalsound> the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme .', \"Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red ,\", 'uh it really should be .', \"It's uh something the user then uh identify with .\", \"This is a red switch off , that's how it should be .\", \"Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that ,\", 'but something to look out for .', \"Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control <vocalsound>\", \"um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by\", 'and s the other examples of that <vocalsound> um <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> The buttons should be large .', \"They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones .\", 'They should be easy to press , very comfortable .', \"<vocalsound> Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um <vocalsound> there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them ,\", \"so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .\", 'Um should avoid s things like that .', 'Um <vocalsound> if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .', 'Okay .', 'Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .', 'Yeah . Okay ,', 'do we have a corporate colour scheme ?', \"<vocalsound> I think it's yellow\", \"I didn't know .\", \"because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow ,\", '<vocalsound> Okay .', 'so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there ,', \"And the Play-Doh 's yellow <vocalsound> .\", 'Okay .', 'Fantastic . <vocalsound>', 'Okay .', 'but keep going', \"and we'll discuss it after .\", 'Yeah .', 'any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden ,', \"they shouldn't be on the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> um\", \"shouldn't be

should definitely avoid the big square block look .', \"That's just wrong .\", \"Mm 'kay .\", \"And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department ,\", \"<vocalsound> and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .\", 'So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take', \"Aye that's a good idea , yeah .\", 'and <gap>

.\", \"I think I'm cool .\", \"It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle <gap> <vocalsound> of the table ,\", \"I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it .\", 'huh ?', 'Just um <disfmarker>', 'Oops .', 'Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um <disfmarker>', 'Yeah okay .', 'Let me just get this going first .', 'Yeah .', 'Ah there it is .', \"<vocalsound> It takes a second , doesn't it ?\", \"'Kay , that should be it .\", 'Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .', \"So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process ,\", 'um and then you can just work through it', \"and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are .\", 'Um the components are exactly the same .', \"Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface .\", 'The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .', 'Um like you said time to market was a problem ,', 'um and how many components are physically in there in cost .', 'And the power is basically a factor of that .', 'Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device ,', 'um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control', \"because um like we've said <disfmarker> we've defined , like we only want the basic things that <disfmarker> to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .\", \"So um you know it's just a matter of working out space .\", 'So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size .', 'These are the three things that um will have an impact on you .', 'So just go through it in the components .', 'Um these are the options that are available to you ,', \"um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .\", 'Right .', 'Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .', 'I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .', 'So maybe if you <disfmarker>', 'well I could see the other email that they sent you ,', \"um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements <vocalsound> , or different offerings of what components availa\", 'Okay so your basic components are buttons ,', 'Right .', 'okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,', \"okay there's an L_C_D_ display ,\", '<vocalsound> um I think these are quite standard things .', \"They're standard , aren't they ?\", 'No', \"um they're <disfmarker>\", 'well in the sense that these are all the options available for you .', \"I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .\", 'Yeah .', \"Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .\", 'It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,', 'um and then the different types of materials that you can use ,', \"um I don't think you can use them in a combination ,\", 'um but um', 'I could check back for you ,', \"but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .\", \"We <disfmarker> you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?\", 'Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine ,', 'but plastic , rubber , and wood ,', \"I wasn't <disfmarker> I'm not very sure about the titanium .\", 'Yeah .', 'They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .', \"Mm 'kay .\", 'Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,', 'but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,', 'Okay .', 'so I think that there is some restriction on um <disfmarker>', 'I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium ,', 'but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .', 'You know as opposed to two .', \"Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips .\", 'The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit', 'um and that impacts cost .', \"Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .\", 'Power consumption should be about the same .', 'Um I think the main impact is complexity ,', 'um and the other thing is um the power options .', 'Um the first one is a standard battery .', 'Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing ,', \"it's a wind-up <vocalsound> you know , a crank <vocalsound> .\", \"I'll clear one of these things for you .\", 'Just by moving it yeah .', 'Yeah', 'but that that might be something <disfmarker> <vocalsound>', \"I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .\", 'I think whatever it is you still need a battery', \"'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .\", 'No .', 'Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell ,', 'Yeah .', \"which may not be a great idea in Europe or <vocalsound> any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .\", 'So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else .', 'Um and the

balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes ,', 'Uh yeah yeah , I see .', 'Yeah .', 'you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .',

the um <vocalsound> the colour ,', 'you said company colour yellow .', 'I mean if we think of something ,', 'like I was saying also lime and lemon you know ,', 'what <disfmarker> can we come up with

would be good', 'sure .', \"wouldn't it .\", 'Yeah .', 'Yeah', 'so yeah should we go with that ?', 'Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a <disfmarker>', 'Do you wanna draw it on the board

else do you need to talk about ?', 'Well i I was just <disfmarker>', 'Where would you physically position the buttons ?', 'Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things .', 'Yeah <gap> .',

really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,\", 'Yeah ,', 'sure .', \"Um I've had kinetic things before ,\", 'I mean what does anybody think about that ?', \"and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it ,\", 'and watches yeah <disfmarker>', 'No ,', \"like I said

down .\", 'Yeah .', 'So we should think about <disfmarker>', \"Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .\", \"So you'd have the

thought .\", 'Yep .', \"Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here .\", \"Chip on print , is that <disfmarker> that's an industrial design thing , is it David ?\", 'Yes yes .', 'Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that <disfmarker>', \"And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .\", 'Yeah', \"I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons\", 'that feel kind of <disfmarker>', 'Yeah I think so yeah .', 'Okay .', 'Um just a a lot of the um <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> I mean one of the things running through my mind right now ,', \"I realise we're being

another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple ,\", \"there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context .\", 'So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,', 'because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions .', \"It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible\", \"um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .\", 'And <gap> was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks ,', 'but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .', 'So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .', 'But there is one problem <gap> then the user has to understand each of that functionality .', 'So <disfmarker>', 'Yeah well we w', 'Because the same button is doing too many things .', 'Yeah', \"well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control .\", 'Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um', '<vocalsound> I I would <disfmarker>', \"if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .\", \"They don't really do anything .\", 'Maybe you know I <disfmarker>', 'although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever ,', 'but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .', 'Um <vocalsound> but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device .', 'Um <disfmarker>', \"H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard\", \"because w if people see a remo see the <disfmarker> see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to <disfmarker> very different build <disfmarker> very different to the traditional <disfmarker>\", 'It does sampling out of the <gap> .', '<vocalsound> Well I guess that depends on how you market it .', 'If you <vocalsound>', 'if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .', 'If y', 'Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?', 'So , but <disfmarker>', 'yep .', 'Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this <disfmarker> a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .', 'So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh <disfmarker> something that would be worth implementing .', \"Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen ,\", 'um which maybe maybe is too expensive ,', \"um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here ,\", 'the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .', 'I think even that ,', 'I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement ,', 'um but I think that would be quite useful as well .', 'And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television ,', \"but I think one <disfmarker> maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of <disfmarker> you can have with technology ,\", \"and maybe we wanna make it something that's <vocalsound> extensible to do other tasks .\", 'Say you have like um <vocalsound> a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room .', \"You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development ,\", 'but , you know , later on you could you can you know you <disfmarker>', 'also , selling the potential of the device .', 'Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,', \"and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as <disfmarker> at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .\", 'Okay . <vocalsound>', 'Okay .', 'Okay , thanks .', '<vocalsound> <gap> you want to go ?', 'Yep .', 'So <disfmarker> yeah .', 'So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh ,', 'that means on my own I <disfmarker>', 'This one ?', 'yeah , it should be .', 'Great .', 'No , not that one .', '<gap> you are two .', 'Two .', 'Alright . <vocalsound>', 'Okay so the working design is uh', 'user i interface could be of two types ,', 'one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology .', 'So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this ,', 'and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote .', \"So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them ,\", 'and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .', 'Okay ,', 'sorry to interrupt you ,', 'but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .', \"That's right .\", \"So anyway , that didn't come into my mind ,\", 'Okay .', 'so th that is a possibility .', 'These could be other kind of interfaces .', 'Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces .', 'So spe buttons are something which is very <disfmarker> everybody is familiar with .', 'So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,', 'and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking .', 'Otherwise we are just like others in the market .', 'So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type ,', 'and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually .', 'So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons .', 'Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required .', 'And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .', 'Yeah .', 'That increases the the cost also .', \"Uh that's right .\", 'But uh means we have to see how much <disfmarker> what kind of microphones and stuff like that .', 'Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well <disfmarker> of such technologies is enough ?', \"Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .\", 'Okay .', 'Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc', 'Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones', \"That's right .\", 'because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .', 'No it it could be little d yeah it could be <disfmarker>', 'So it could be s a few centimetres .', '<vocalsound> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,', \"That's right . That's right .\", \"because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries .\", 'Yeah .', 'So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for <disfmarker>', 'Mm-hmm mm-hmm .', \"Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing\", 'so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest .', 'So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself ,', \"and <vocalsound> it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is ,\", 'instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .', 'Yeah .', 'Okay .', 'Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .', \"Yeah , that's right .\", 'Yeah .', 'So we can', 'This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .', \"That's right . Yep .\", 'Okay , next .', 'Yep .', 'Uh that finished ?', 'No no .', 'Components .', 'No ?', 'Components ?', 'Yeah .', 'So , will you go to the next slide ?', '<vocalsound> Yes sure .', '<vocalsound> Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so .', 'We are having a power button and the switch <vocalsound> , which is not much ,', 'and then we are having the <gap> which is to indicate whether the power is on or not .', 'And then there are two kind of things which can be <disfmarker>', 'so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time <vocalsound> .', 'So we could not put that .', 'So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there .', 'So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there ,', 'and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller ,', 'and then there could be buttons ,', 'and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .', 'And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one ,', 'and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .', 'Okay .', 'So this is the easiest design the there could be .', 'So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in <gap> .', 'To have different technologies .', 'So this was the <disfmarker>', 'my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .', \"You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know <vocalsound> turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button\", 'Yeah .', 'like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing <disfmarker> <vocalsound>', 'Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .', '<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay .', 'Yeah .', 'So these are the slight problems .', 'So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?', 'Because <disfmarker>', 'yeah', 'the reason is that if we go into the market means <disfmarker>', \"though I don't have much idea ,\", 'but as he <disfmarker> the uh Marketing Expert presentation was <disfmarker>', \"I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <vocalsound> everyone will s will buy it .\", \"<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually I'm not so sure\", '<vocalsound> So if we go with just the <disfmarker>', \"I'm sure .\", \"because I'm the <disfmarker>\", \"you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm <disfmarker> instead of pressing up on on a remote control .\", \"You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said ,\", 'Yeah .', 'so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .', 'Okay so <disfmarker>', \"Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about <vocalsound>\", \"Well it depends if it's a remote control th\", \"it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .\", \"Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .\", \"If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be <gap> .\", '<vocalsound> Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .', 'Alright .', \"Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said .\", 'We are targeting T_V_ . <vocalsound>', 'We need <vocalsound>', 'we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy ,', 'which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .', 'Um we have <disfmarker>', 'With a good shape for the <disfmarker>', 'or good shape , yes .', 'We should bring new technologies for young peoples ,', 'and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet .', 'Maybe this is something we can stick to it .', \"And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .\", \"So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_\", '<vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .', 'Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ .', 'Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ <disfmarker> in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback <disfmarker> to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .', 'Well it depends though <disfmarker> well it depends .', \"If we we don't <disfmarker>\", \"unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that .\", 'Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there ,', 'but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of <disfmarker> something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus .', \"So that's an extra\", \"<vocalsound> Yeah that's right .\", \"Don don't you ha\", 'cost .', \"don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or <gap> well systems that exist that we can use ?\", 'Well this is this is another que', \"we still haven't really defined the remote .\", 'Are we still <disfmarker>', \"you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?\", 'Yeah .', \"'Cause that really makes a big difference .\", \"'Cause <vocalsound> even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s .\", \"It's just there are too many T_V_s out there .\", \"Yeah . That's good point .\", \"It's it's not really gonna <disfmarker>\", \"What's what cou what could be the cost of uh <disfmarker>\", 'well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?', \"For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible .\", 'Yeah .', \"It's not possible . It's impossible .\", 'But but I dunno ,', 'Yeah .', 'I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that <disfmarker> any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro', 'because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,', 'and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics .', \"So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh\", 'Uh <disfmarker>', 'of increasing the unit price .', 'What would be <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is <disfmarker> which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um <disfmarker> in terms to had <disfmarker> to have really an added value ?', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah', 'because <disfmarker>', 'Okay ,', 'yeah .', 'so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is <disfmarker>', 'Wha but what would be <disfmarker>', 'one question ,', 'what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?', 'Well th', 'What what kind of information ?', \"'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .\", 'Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the', 'They have tele teletext .', 'Well , because they have teletext on it .', 'the n', 'Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel .', 'Yeah', 'but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .', 'They have t most of them have teletext ,', 'Yeah .', 'but we want to get rid <disfmarker> well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet .', 'So to to uh', 'You can get a lot more information on it .', 'to browse more easily the teletext .

anybody know ?', \"Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .\", 'I dunno .', 'Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .', 'Okay .', 'And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,', \"but I don't know if it's worth the cost .\", \"So we've got to discuss that .\", 'Okay , jolly good .', '<vocalsound> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .', 'You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one ,', 'if you know what I mean , so <disfmarker>', \"What's a double curved one ?\", 'You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .', 'So <disfmarker>', 'Okay .', '<vocalsound> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium .', \"And th for each of them you have uh cases where <disfmarker> for example titanium , you can't use it for <disfmarker> if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium .\", \"And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex

four ?', 'Where does the number four come from ?', \"'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .\", 'Okay right ,', \"so we're writing down four .\", \"So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .\", '<vocalsound> Okay .', 'How about these ?', 'Are we wanting them in <disfmarker>', 'No .', 'no', \"they're just <disfmarker>\", 'is everything gonna be plastic ?', 'Yep .', 'Yep .', 'Okay .', \"So we're w w quite far over .\", \"Now we're gonna <disfmarker>\", \"something's gonna have to go .\", \"Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>\", 'Uh how mm-hmm <disfmarker>', 'how are we going to achieve this high-end product if <disfmarker>', 'Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro ,', 'We only have very sparse <disfmarker>', 'so', 'let me see ,', 'what are we <disfmarker>', 'Two point three ?', 'I mean <disfmarker>', 'Four point three', 'no ?', 'oh yes', 'sorry ,', 'four point three .', 'My maths is all out .', 'Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .', 'Yeah .', 'And then where is the <disfmarker>', 'How much would that save us ?', 'How much would that save us ?', 'That will only save you one .', 'That is one .', 'One .', 'The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,', 'um because when you', 'do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well ,', 'so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing', \"That's fair enough , yeah .\", 'so we may not need to <disfmarker>', 'so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,', 'Okay so <disfmarker>', 'which I think is a technically doable thing so <disfmarker>', \"So w what's our reviewed suggestion ?\", 'Um take away the L_C_ display ?', 'Yep .', 'And the advanced chip goes away as well .', 'To be replaced with a', 'Regular chip .', 'regular chip .', 'Yep .', 'Okay .', 'So what that means is that um <disfmarker>', \"<vocalsound> And so we've got point three to get rid of .\", 'Um and we ha', 'where are the four <disfmarker> the four push buttons are where exactly now ?', 'The twelve buttons that you see there <vocalsound> .', 'Twelve buttons .', \"That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so <disfmarker>\", 'Yeah .', \"Functionally you're gonna have to intercept <disfmarker>\", 'So four is a good estimate for <disfmarker>', 'Do you think ?', 'Yeah ,', \"so you can't actually cut <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\", \"It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .\", 'Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,', 'how can it be something in between ?', \"It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .\", 'Okay', 'well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .', 'We just report that it has to be over budget <vocalsound> ,', 'or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .', 'No can do .', 'Yeah', 'we could just go with um <disfmarker>', 'Yeah w', 'Normal coloured buttons .', 'Well do you want colour differentiation here ?', \"No that's not the button we're talking about .\", 'Um <disfmarker>', 'Oh yeah sorry yeah then . <vocalsound>', \"That's <disfmarker>\", 'the buttons only refer to the pad so <disfmarker>', 'Right', 'so <disfmarker>', 'Should we take that off uh ?', \"Hey it's back to the original .\", \"That's it .\", 'Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,', 'so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .', 'Okay ,', \"ach that's a shame .\", '<vocalsound> Um right ,', 'so take away that completely ?', \"And now we're under budget .\", 'So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .', '<vocalsound> So I reckon <disfmarker>', 'Um <disfmarker>', \"How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?\", \"Doesn't say so . <vocalsound>\", 'Yeah .', \"That's a freebie .\", 'Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .', 'Yeah .', \"Yeah that's a good idea .\", 'Just one ?', 'Does that mean that one button has a special form or <disfmarker>', \"I think <gap> there's just one button so\", 'Yeah okay .', 'handy <vocalsound> .', 'Well well there we go .', \"So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now .\", \"So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore ,\", \"and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing ,\", 'which I think is fair enough ,', 'and so this is gonna be one big thing here .', 'Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible

in your hands rather than being wide and flat .', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah', \"that's what I was thinking , to\", 'Sure , okay .', \"We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . <vocalsound>\", 'Yeah alright yeah fair enough .', \"Okay , just thought I'd ask .\", \"So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add ,\", 'and you might want to add in the report ,', 'length , width , and height .', 'Right okay .', 'Yeah .', 'So just to well to be thorough then ,', \"width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?\", 'Yeah .', 'Okay', 'and then so height-wise <disfmarker>', 'How how tall do you envisage it being ?', 'About that big ?', 'Yeah it works , yeah .', 'Two .', 'About two centimetres , okay .', \"Two's not very high at all though .\", 'Maybe a bit higher ?', 'This is about this is about two .', 'Slightly more than two , so <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> Yeah .', 'See , about that thick .', 'Okay .', 'Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .', 'Ach , that is <disfmarker>', 'Yeah .', 'Okay .', \"Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .\", 'Okay um', 'so we have it within cost anyway .', 'Um so yeah', 'project evaluation is this point .', 'Right uh .', 'Okay so can we close that ?', \"This is what it's <disfmarker> the final spec that it's gonna be .\", 'Someone is gonna have to <disfmarker>', \"yeah that's fine that's fine .\", \"Um it's probably just <disfmarker>\", \"I dunno if it's worth getting into ,\", 'but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,', \"because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that <disfmarker>\", \"I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,\", 'Yeah .', 'so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .', 'Sure , okay .', 'The the look and the colour is something which is cool ,', 'Yeah , alright .', \"but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar\", 'Okay , sure .', 'then um <disfmarker> because when you put it on the shelf <disfmarker>', 'What about button shape ?', 'Square buttons ?', 'Yeah', 'button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning ,', 'Okay .', 'Yeah .', \"'cause I think positioning is <disfmarker> we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of\", 'Sure .', '<vocalsound> Yeah .', 'Yeah .', '<vocalsound> Okay .', 'pad .', 'Right um .', 'So at this point we uh ,', 'let me see ,', 'discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points ,', 'with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork ,', 'and the stuff we had around us I guess .', \"Mm 'kay .\", 'Um ,', 'let me see uh <disfmarker>', 'Do you want me to d um <disfmarker>', '<vocalsound> Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ?', \"<vocalsound> Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was <disfmarker>\", 'Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .', 'Or <disfmarker>', 'Yeah', 'Evaluation .', ', yeah go for that first .', \"I wasn't entirely sure what uh <disfmarker> who was supposed to be doing that ,\", 'Okay .', 'but y you go for it .', 'Sure .', \"Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint ,\", 'Okay .', \"I'll try and do it as quick as possible .\", 'Okay .', 'Um , this is um <disfmarker>', \"I'll just go over your head\", \"if that's okay .\", 'Yeah .', \"I don't think you need the power ,\", 'so <disfmarker> <vocalsound>', \"What's that ?\", \"No , that's okay that's okay .\", \"I don't need the PowerPoint ?\", 'No , the power cord itself .', 'Oh <gap> course ,', 'Yeah ,', \"yeah that's true .\", 'so then you have a bit more freedom to <disfmarker>', 'Let me get that .', 'A bit more .', 'Okay ,', 'You you still have your blue fingers .', 'so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a <disfmarker>', 'Is it ?', 'You killed a monster .', \"The idea is that I've set up <disfmarker>\", \"I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,\", 'and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,', 'and uh so we can review that .', \"Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary\",

to most remote controls you see that's pretty good .\", 'Yeah .', 'I dunno like a six or something .', 'Yeah .', 'Yeah', 'What does anybody else think ?', \"um me uh my only reservation with it was

.\", 'What do you guys think ?', 'I would say five or six .', 'Okay .', 'David ?', \"Yep I'm fine with that .\", \"Okay let's go with five then .\", 'Okay .', 'Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .', \"It's one to seven , right ?\", 'The <disfmarker>', 'Oh yes', 'sorry then', 'So it meant three ,', ', then I would say two or three .', 'okay .', 'Wait ,', \"what's the scale , one to seven , right

mean', 'my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement <disfmarker>', 'From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?', 'Yeah from

.\", 'Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .', \"<vocalsound> But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the <vocalsound>

.', 'What is this single curved <disfmarker>', 'what does it mean ?', \"Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .\", \"So it's it's not <disfmarker>\", 'You you will have the

basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .\", 'Um they , you know ,', \"seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .\", 'Completely ugly .', \"Um they they didn't match the

'we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control .', 'And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the

know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control .', 'And basically they came <disfmarker> they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,', 'um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high

the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury .', \"<vocalsound> We also asked some users about some specific

high technology features .', 'Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .', 'Whereas um <vocalsound> the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control .', \"So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market
